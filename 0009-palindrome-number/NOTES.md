The approch is simple-
First- we convert that number to string 
Second- we check if the first character of that string is equal to the last character then we move forward from starting pont and backward from end point until we reach the half the length of that string or we say starting pointer become greater than last pointer. 
if any of the character on first pointer does not match with last pointer's character then return false otherwise return true
