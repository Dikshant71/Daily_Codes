1) The approach is simple-
2) we convert that number to a string 
3) we check if the first character of that string is equal to the last character then we move forward from starting point and backward from the endpoint until we 
   reach half the length of that string or we say starting pointer becomes greater than the last pointer. 
4) if any of the character on the first pointer does not match with the last pointer's character then return false otherwise return true
